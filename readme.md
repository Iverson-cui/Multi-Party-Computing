This repository contains my self-made implementation of some frequently used protocol in MPC. For convenience, all of the protocols omit the need for communication between multiple hosts and simplify them to two class in a file.
I have not only finished the well-known part, but also tried to added some premium features mentioned in the papers of the MPC field. Details and features can be seen in the corresponding readme files in the directories.
For now, this repository contains:
- OT
- Public key encryption
- GMW protocol
- Yao's Garbled Circuit
